# 🚀 DART MCP Deployment Summary

After multiple deployment attempts, here's the current status and next steps:

## 📊 **Deployment Status:**

### **❌ Render - Failed Multiple Times**
- **Issue**: Render ignores our configuration files
- **Problem**: Still tries to use `uvicorn` with `dart_mcp` module
- **Status**: Not recommended due to configuration caching issues

### **❌ Railway - Build Successful, Health Check Failed**
- **Issue**: Using Dockerfile.simple with package installation
- **Problem**: Health check fails because server doesn't start properly
- **Status**: Fixed with new configuration (Nixpacks + main.py)

### **✅ Ready for Deployment**
- **main.py**: Completely standalone server
- **Multiple configs**: Railway, Fly.io, Heroku ready
- **Tested locally**: Works perfectly

## 🎯 **Recommended Next Steps:**

### **Option 1: Retry Railway (Fixed)**
The Railway configuration has been updated:
- ✅ Uses Nixpacks builder (no Docker issues)
- ✅ Uses `main.py` (completely standalone)
- ✅ Simplified requirements.txt
- ✅ Proper health check configuration

**Go to Railway dashboard and retry deployment.**

### **Option 2: Try Fly.io (Alternative)**
Fly.io is often more reliable for Python apps:

1. **Go to [fly.io](https://fly.io)**
2. **Sign up/Login with GitHub**
3. **Click "Launch App"**
4. **Connect repository**: `brewhouse/dart-mcp`
5. **Use `fly.toml` configuration**

### **Option 3: Try Heroku (Alternative)**
Heroku has excellent Python support:

1. **Go to [heroku.com](https://heroku.com)**
2. **Create new app**
3. **Connect GitHub repository**: `brewhouse/dart-mcp`
4. **Use `Procfile` configuration**

## 🧪 **Test Your Deployment:**

Once deployed, test these endpoints:

```bash
# Health check
curl https://your-app-url/health

# Test endpoint
curl https://your-app-url/test

# List routes
curl https://your-app-url/mcp/routes

# List stations
curl https://your-app-url/mcp/stations
```

## 🎯 **For CustomGPT.ai:**

Use your deployment URL as the MCP server URL in CustomGPT.ai.

## 📋 **Available Files:**

- **`main.py`** - Completely standalone server (RECOMMENDED)
- **`railway.json`** - Railway configuration (UPDATED)
- **`fly.toml`** - Fly.io configuration
- **`Procfile`** - Heroku configuration
- **`nixpacks.toml`** - Railway Nixpacks configuration
- **`requirements.txt`** - Simplified dependencies

## 🚨 **Key Fixes Applied:**

1. **Eliminated package installation issues** - `main.py` is completely standalone
2. **Fixed Railway configuration** - Uses Nixpacks instead of Dockerfile
3. **Simplified dependencies** - Only FastAPI and uvicorn needed
4. **Multiple deployment options** - Railway, Fly.io, Heroku ready

---

**🎯 The Railway deployment should now work with the Nixpacks configuration and standalone main.py. If Railway still fails, try Fly.io or Heroku.**
